# Spider-Verse
Spider-Verse: Tracking and Searching Algorithm Used to Discover Anomalies

Spider-Verse Graph Project
This Java project involves implementing data structures and algorithms to model and manage the Spider-Verse, focusing on undirected graphs and adjacency lists. Here's a summary of the tasks and techniques used:

Clusters.java:

Task: Create a separate-chaining hash table to group dimensions into clusters.
Techniques: Hash functions, rehashing, linked lists.

Collider.java:

Task: Build an adjacency list from the cluster data for efficient dimension navigation.
Techniques: Graph representation, adjacency lists.

TrackSpot.java:

Task: Use Depth First Search (DFS) to track a villain across dimensions.
Techniques: DFS traversal, path reconstruction.

CollectAnomalies.java:

Task: Identify and collect anomalies using Breadth First Search (BFS).
Techniques: BFS traversal, shortest path finding.

GoHomeMachine.java:

Task: Return anomalies to their home dimensions using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Techniques: Dijkstra’s algorithm, weighted graphs, shortest path finding.

SaveMiles.java (in progress):

Task: Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to gather Spiders for a rescue mission.
Techniques: Dijkstra’s algorithm, meeting point optimization.

CanonEvent.java (in progress):

Task: Manage and update dimensional connections based on canon events.
Techniques: Graph connectivity, component analysis.

Implementation Details:

Data Structures: Hash tables, linked lists, adjacency lists, weighted graphs.
Algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s algorithm.
Java Utilization: Extensive use of Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.).
